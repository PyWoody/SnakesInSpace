"""
This recipe shows how to more efficiently strip all of the minable Asteroids
in the Agent's current System. By using a Queue of Asteroid Symbols, the recipe
demonstrates how Waypoints can be easily serialized. The shared Queue between
threads is also a more efficient means of extraction, compared to the
default example in the README.

The recipe can be run in it's own thread and it requires no monitoring,
which is ideal for running as a sub-script for a larger game.

Each new iteration of agent.fleet will return the most up-to-date
list of available Ships. Meaning, if you purchase additional Ships
in a seperate thread in the time between iterations and those Ships can_mine,
the Ships will automatically show up here.
